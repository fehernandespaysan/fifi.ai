## ⚠️ Pre-Deployment Requirements

### Critical (Must Do Before Deployment)

1. **Replace Demo Blog Content** ⚠️
   - Current: 4 demo blog posts
   - Required: 3-5 real blog posts based on your expertise
   - Time estimate: 2-3 hours
   - Topics: RAG, AI Engineering, Security, your experience building this

### Recommended (Should Do Before Deployment)

2. **Test with Real Content**
   - Generate embeddings from real blogs
   - Test RAG responses for accuracy
   - Verify source citations work correctly

3. **Set Up OpenAI Billing Alerts**
   - Recommended limit: $10-20/month
   - Monitor usage daily for first week

### Optional (Nice to Have)

4. **Create CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Guidelines for contributors
   - Code of conduct
   - Issue/PR templates

5. **Set Up GitHub Workflows**
   - Automated testing on PR
   - Security scans
   - Coverage reports

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Repository cleanup - **COMPLETE**
2. 📝 Create real blog content - **IN PROGRESS** (you're doing this)

### After Content Creation (1-2 hours)
1. Test RAG with real content locally
2. Review and finalize responses
3. Commit real blog posts to repo

### Deployment (30 minutes)
1. Follow `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` checklist
2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
3. Verify deployment works
4. Test live app thoroughly

### Post-Deployment (Week 1)
1. Monitor daily for issues
2. Gather initial user feedback
3. Track OpenAI API costs
4. Iterate based on feedback
