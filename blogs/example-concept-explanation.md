# Vector Databases Explained

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and search through vector embeddings efficiently. They're essential for building RAG systems, recommendation engines, and semantic search applications.

## What Are Vector Embeddings?

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) in high-dimensional space. Similar items are positioned close together in this space, which allows for semantic similarity search.

For example:
- "dog" and "puppy" would be close together
- "car" and "vehicle" would be close together
- "dog" and "car" would be far apart

## Why You Need a Vector Database

Regular databases (SQL, NoSQL) are optimized for exact matches and structured queries. Vector databases are optimized for similarity search - finding items that are "close" to a query vector.

### Key Operations

1. **Insert**: Add vectors with metadata
2. **Search**: Find K nearest neighbors (KNN) to a query vector
3. **Update**: Modify vectors or metadata
4. **Delete**: Remove vectors from the index

## FAISS: Facebook AI Similarity Search

FAISS is an open-source library developed by Facebook (Meta) for efficient similarity search.

### Pros:
- **Free and open source**
- **Extremely fast** for local searches
- **Runs on your machine** - no API costs
- **Great for development** and small-to-medium datasets
- **Python-friendly**

### Cons:
- **No built-in persistence** - you manage file storage
- **Limited filtering** capabilities
- **Single-machine** - doesn't scale horizontally
- **No multi-user** support out of the box

### Best For:
- Development and prototyping
- Projects with < 1M vectors
- Local-first applications
- Cost-sensitive projects

## Pinecone: Managed Vector Database

Pinecone is a fully-managed vector database service with enterprise features.

### Pros:
- **Fully managed** - no infrastructure to maintain
- **Scales automatically** - handles billions of vectors
- **Built-in filtering** - combine vector search with metadata filters
- **Multi-region** deployment
- **Real-time updates**
- **High availability**

### Cons:
- **Costs money** - starts at $70/month
- **API-based** - network latency
- **Vendor lock-in**
- **Requires internet connection**

### Best For:
- Production applications
- Projects with > 500K vectors
- Teams without ML infrastructure
- Applications needing 99.9%+ uptime

## Other Options

### Weaviate
- Open source with cloud offering
- GraphQL API
- Good for complex filtering
- Self-hostable

### Qdrant
- Rust-based (fast!)
- Good filtering capabilities
- Self-hostable or cloud
- Developer-friendly API

### Milvus
- Distributed architecture
- Handles massive scale
- More complex to set up
- Enterprise-focused

## Choosing the Right Vector Database

Start with **FAISS** for:
- Learning and prototyping
- MVPs and proof-of-concepts
- Budget constraints
- < 1M vectors

Migrate to **Pinecone/Qdrant/Weaviate** when:
- You have > 500K vectors
- You need high availability
- You want managed infrastructure
- Budget allows ($70-500/month)

## Performance Comparison

| Database | Latency (p95) | Max Vectors | Cost |
|----------|---------------|-------------|------|
| FAISS | < 10ms | ~1M | Free |
| Pinecone | < 50ms | Billions | $70+/mo |
| Qdrant | < 20ms | 100M+ | Free (self) |
| Weaviate | < 30ms | 100M+ | Free (self) |

## Getting Started with FAISS

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Create an index for 128-dimensional vectors
dimension = 128
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)

# Add vectors
vectors = np.random.random((1000, dimension)).astype('float32')
index.add(vectors)

# Search for 5 nearest neighbors
query = np.random.random((1, dimension)).astype('float32')
distances, indices = index.search(query, k=5)
```

In our next post, we'll build a complete RAG system using FAISS!
